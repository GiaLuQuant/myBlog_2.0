Thank you for visiting my page. I am an M.S student in the Department of Psychology at Sun Yat-sen University, advised by Professor Zijun Ke. 


**Research Interests** 

Within [**Psychological Statistics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_statistics), I am particularly interested in [**Causal Inference**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference) and [**Meta-analysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis).

Previsouly, I have done some work in
- strengthing causality in mediation analysis
- refining modeling approaches for experimental mediation
- advancing mediation meta-analysis for clinical research


Currently, I am working on

- Publication Bias in Mediation Meta-analysis 

In the future, I may devote more efforts on High-dimensional Statistics
