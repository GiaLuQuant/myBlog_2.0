I am an M.S student working in [**Psychological Statistics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_statistics). 

My research interests revolve around [causal inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference) and [meta-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis), specifically in the following areas


- Causality in [Mediation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation_(statistics)) Analysis
- Mediation Meta-analysis
- [Instrumental Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variable) regression in multivariate models

**Currently Working On**

- Publication Bias in Mediation Meta-analysis Based on Pretest-posttest-control-group Designs


**Potential Future Directions:** Non-parametric models / High-dimensional Data analysis
